# ASP.NET-MVC-Scaffolding
A GitHub repository of the Codeplex Mvc Scaffolding Project (https://mvcscaffolding.codeplex.com/)
This project is a continuation of the work done by Steve Sanderson & Scott Hanselman on developing Mvc Scaffolding. 

The original source can be found at: https://mvcscaffolding.codeplex.com/

The original is no longer supported by the original authors as they've now introduced an alternative Asp.Net Scaffolding (http://www.asp.net/visual-studio/overview/2013/aspnet-scaffolding-overview) to Visual Studio. However, this leaves users of the Mvc Scaffolding project in the lurch if they wish to continue to use their own templates and scripts with Visual Studio 2013 and above.

I have pulled the original source and fixed the issue which was preventing most from using it in Visual Studio 2015. I believe there is still an issue in using it with Visual Studio 2013 (Update 5), but I'm opening the floor for other contributors.

Happy Scaffolding!
